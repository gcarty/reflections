How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- saves time finding differences and reverting to old code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros
- Greater control
- Sized according to the type of change
Cons
- Forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Git tracks logical association between files that are dependent on each other
- Google tracks individual files because it was not built to track logical associations

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- git log shows the changes between different commits
- git diff shows what changes were made between

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- Confidence you can find it later by dtrying different versions until you find the one that introduced the error
